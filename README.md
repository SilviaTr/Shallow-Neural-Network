# ShallowNeuralNetwork

## Description
This Python project integrates a basic neural network with a Streamlit interface, enabling the visualization of decision boundaries in a two-class system. It's a practical tool for understanding neural network dynamics and data classification.

## Features
- Custom neural network implementation with adjustable layers and neurons.
- Data generation for two classes with modifiable modes and variances.
- Interactive parameter adjustment using Streamlit for real-time visualization.
- Decision boundary plotting using Matplotlib.

## Installation
Clone the repository and install the required packages:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SilviaTr/ShallowNeuralNetwork.git
cd ShallowNeuralNetwork
pip install -r requirements.txt
